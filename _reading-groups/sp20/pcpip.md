Over the past 3 decades, one of the biggest advancements in theoretical computer science has come from how we look at the complexity of a problem: instead of considering the fastest algorithms that find a correct solution, what is the complexity of a procedure that verifies correctness and authenticity of a solution? Does it require multiple rounds of conversation? If so what are the fewest number of rounds that are necessary? Does this answer change when you incorporate randomness: that is, potentially accept incorrect solutions albeit with small probability? Can this notion be carried out reading extremely minimal sections of the proof? Is it possible to convince someone you have the correct solution without giving away what that solution is? All of these intuitive and interesting questions are explored with rigor in the PCP/IP reading group. We will learn the basics of interactive, zero-knowledge, and probabilistically checkable proofs, as well as their various applications.
