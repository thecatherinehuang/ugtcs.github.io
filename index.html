            Hi everyone, welcome back! I hope your semester has started off well.
            We’ll be having our first general meeting on Monday, February 3 at 7pm
            in Soda 380. Come eat free food and listen to us announce our two
            reading groups for the semester as well as some smaller groups that
            allow you to meet people and either do some theory research or focus
            on a topic you’re more interested in.
